ADABOT
======

A distributed IRC bot/client. Uses the folowing modules:
 * irc -- npm install irc
 * zeromq -- npm install zeromq
 * cradle -- npm install cradle

Currently, it connects to IRC with irc_client.js, which starts sending messages
to all 0mq subscribers.

It logs all messages to CouchDB with the irc_db.js process.

Eventually it will feature a web IRC client based on:
 * socket.io
 * express

How to use
